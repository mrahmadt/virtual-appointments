# Virtual-Fast
With the current COVID-19 outbreak and the curfew across the world, many customers facing organizations (Hospitals, Courts, branches) are looking to continue their services with the fastest way possible to run virtual appointment/clinic/court services without introducing too much complexity into their environment and to utilize their current appointment system for scheduling the virtual appointment with their customers.

With "Virtual-Fast" script, you can quickly provide it with a CSV file of all the appointments scheduled for your customers. It will generate for you a Microsoft Teams meeting link for each appointment that you can share it with your customer using any channel you are using to communicate with them (SMS, email, WhatsApp....).
